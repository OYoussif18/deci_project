Introduction
The cleaned dataset from the @WeRateDogs Twitter archive provides a unique opportunity to explore public engagement with tweets about dogs. We aimed to identify popular breeds, engagement trends, and the correlation between ratings and tweet popularity.

Key Insights
1. Most Common Dog Breeds
The most frequently predicted dog breed was the Golden Retriever, followed by Labrador Retriever and Pembroke. This shows that certain breeds tend to dominate Twitter discussions.

2. Tweet Engagement Over Time
We observed that 2016 had the highest retweet count, followed by 2017. 2015 had the lowest, likely due to fewer tweets or a smaller audience base at the time.

3. Rating vs. Popularity
We found a mild positive correlation (0.3) between a dogâ€™s rating and the number of retweets. While higher-rated dogs tend to get more attention, the correlation is not strong enough to be conclusive.

df['rating'].corr(df['retweet_count'])  # Result: ~0.3

4. Top-Rated Breeds
We filtered for dogs with the highest rating (10) and found that Golden Retrievers and Pembrokes were the most common among the top-rated group. This suggests these breeds are not just popular but also highly rated.

top_rated = df[df['rating'] == df['rating'].max()]
top_rated['Dog_name'].value_counts()

Conclusion
This analysis confirms that breed recognition and rating influence engagement on Twitter, albeit to a limited extent. Golden Retrievers lead in popularity, but Pembrokes are often top-rated. By merging image data, tweet metadata, and statistics, we uncovered patterns that help explain how people engage with content about dogs.
