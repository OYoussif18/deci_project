Twitter Dog Ratings Analysis Report
Author: Omar Mohammed

1. Introduction
This report analyzes Twitter data containing dog images, user ratings, and engagement metrics (likes, retweets). The goal was to:

Identify the most common dog breeds posted on Twitter.

Examine the relationship between dog ratings and tweet popularity.

Determine which breeds received the highest ratings.

Analyze engagement trends over time.

2. Data Sources & Methodology
Data Collection
Tweet JSON Data (tweet-json.txt):

Contains tweet text, timestamps, favorites, and retweets.

Ratings extracted using regex (e.g., "13/10").

Image Predictions (image-predictions.tsv):

Contains AI-predicted dog breeds and confidence scores.

Data Cleaning & Processing
Merged datasets on tweet ID.

Filtered for:

Only high-confidence dog predictions (p1_dog = True, p1_conf > 0.2).

Removed duplicates and missing values.

Final dataset columns:

created_at (tweet date)

Dog_name (predicted breed)

rating (user-assigned score)

favorite_count (likes)

retweet_count (shares)

3. Key Findings
3.1 Most Common Dog Breeds
The top 3 predicted breeds were:

Golden Retriever (most frequent)

Labrador Retriever

Pembroke (Welsh Corgi)

Implication: These breeds are likely the most popular or recognizable on social media.

3.2 Ratings vs. Engagement
Weak positive correlation (0.3) between rating and retweet_count.

Interpretation: Higher-rated dogs tend to get slightly more shares, but other factors (image quality, humor, timing) may play a bigger role.

3.3 Highest-Rated Dogs
Maximum rating: 14/10 (exceeds the usual 10/10 scale, suggesting humorous exaggeration).

Top breeds at 14/10:

Golden Retriever

Pembroke

Insight: Users may be more inclined to "overrate" certain breeds as a joke.

3.4 Engagement Trends Over Time
Highest retweets: 2016

Decline in 2017

Lowest in 2015

Possible reasons:

Algorithm changes on Twitter.

Shifts in user behavior.

Seasonal trends (e.g., fewer dog posts in winter).

4. Visualizations
Retweet Counts by Year
(Bar chart showing engagement trends from 2015–2017)

Observation:

2016 had peak engagement, suggesting optimal posting conditions that year.

5. Conclusions & Recommendations
Conclusions
Golden Retrievers dominate Twitter dog posts, followed by Labs and Pembrokes.

Ratings weakly predict engagement—other factors likely matter more.

Users exaggerate ratings for humor (e.g., 14/10).

Engagement peaked in 2016, then declined.

Recommendations
✅ For dog accounts: Post Golden Retrievers, Labs, or Pembrokes for higher visibility.
✅ For viral potential: Combine high ratings with funny captions.
✅ Timing matters: Analyze why 2016 performed best—was it a trend, algorithm change, or seasonal effect?

6. Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations
Small dataset (only a few years of tweets).

AI breed predictions may have errors.

No text analysis (captions could influence engagement).

Future Work
Expand dataset to include more recent tweets.

Analyze tweet text for keywords/humor.

Compare with non-dog tweets to see if trends are unique to pet content.

7. Dataset Availability
The cleaned dataset (twitter_archive_master.csv) is available for further analysis.
